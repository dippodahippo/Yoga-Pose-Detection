# Yoga-Pose-Detection
A part of an Engineering Clinics project, done by me.

## Features
-Pose Estimation: Put in the filename and directory of the pose in "image_path" (jpg format) and the code will map out the image.
-Pose Comparison: Your camera will be operated by OpenCV and will constantly compare your pose to the image provided.
-Accuracy Calculation: Based on how closely the landmarks appear, the system calculates the accuracy and displays it on the screen.

## Requirements
-OpenCV
-Mediapipe
-Python 3.11

## Installation
